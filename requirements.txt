# Distributed K-Means Production Requirements
# Version 2.0 - Production-Hardened

# Core Dependencies
pyspark>=3.0.0          # Distributed computing framework
numpy>=1.19.0           # Vectorized operations and numerical computing
scikit-learn>=0.24.0    # For validation and test data generation only

# Optional Dependencies (for reporting/visualization)
reportlab>=3.5.0        # PDF report generation (optional)
matplotlib>=3.3.0       # Visualization and speedup graphs (optional)

# Production Recommendations:
# - Use Python 3.8+ (tested up to 3.11)
# - PySpark 3.4+ recommended for latest optimizations
# - NumPy version must support vectorized operations
# - scikit-learn only needed for testing/validation, not production runtime

# Installation:
# pip install -r requirements.txt

# Minimal Production Install (without optional deps):
# pip install pyspark numpy

# Note: The implementation has ZERO runtime dependency on scikit-learn
# scikit-learn is only imported in test functions for validation
